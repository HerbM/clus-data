====== Function EXPORT ======

====Syntax====
  * **export** //symbols ''&optional'' package// â†’ **[[CL:Constant Variables:t]]**

====Arguments and Values====
  * //symbols// - a //[[CL:Glossary:designator]]// for a //[[CL:Glossary:list]]// of //[[CL:Glossary:symbols]]//.
  * //package// - a //[[CL:Glossary:package designator]]//. The default is the //[[CL:Glossary:current package]]//.

====Description====
**export** makes one or more //symbols// that are //[[CL:Glossary:accessible]]// in //package// (whether directly or by inheritance) be //[[CL:Glossary:external symbols]]// of that //package//.

If any of the //symbols// is already //[[CL:Glossary:accessible]]// as an //[[CL:Glossary:external symbol]]// of //package//, **export** has no effect on that //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]//. If the //symbol// is //[[CL:Glossary:present]]// in //package// as an internal symbol, it is simply changed to external status. If it is //[[CL:Glossary:accessible]]// as an //[[CL:Glossary:internal symbol]]// via **[[CL:Functions:use-package]]**, it is first //[[CL:Glossary:import|imported]]// into //package//, then //[[CL:Glossary:exported]]//. (The //symbol// is then //[[CL:Glossary:present]]// in the //package// whether or not //package// continues to use the //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// through which the //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// was originally inherited.)

**export** makes each //symbol// //[[CL:Glossary:accessible]]// to all the //[[CL:Glossary:package|packages]]// that use //package//. All of these //[[CL:Glossary:package|packages]]// are checked for name conflicts: ''(export //s// //p//)'' does ''([[CL:Functions:find-symbol]] ([[CL:Functions:symbol-name]] //s//) //q//)'' for each package ''q'' in ''([[CL:Functions:package-used-by-list]] //p//)''. Note that in the usual case of an **export** during the initial definition of a //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//, the result of **[[CL:Functions:package-used-by-list]]** is **[[CL:Constant Variables:nil]]** and the name-conflict checking takes negligible time. When multiple changes are to be made, for example when **export** is given a //list// of //symbols//, it is permissible for the implementation to process each change separately, so that aborting from a name conflict caused by any but the first //symbol// in the //[[CL:Glossary:list]]// does not unexport the first //symbol// in the //list//. However, aborting from a name-conflict error caused by **export** of one of //symbols// does not leave that //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// //[[CL:Glossary:accessible]]// to some //[[CL:Glossary:package|packages]]// and //[[CL:Glossary:inaccessible]]// to others; with respect to each of //symbols// processed, **export** behaves as if it were as an atomic operation.

A name conflict in **export** between one of //symbols// being exported and a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// already //[[CL:Glossary:present]]// in a //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// that would inherit the newly-exported //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// may be resolved in favor of the exported //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// by uninterning the other one, or in favor of the already-present //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// by making it a shadowing symbol.

====Examples====
<blockquote>
([[CL:Functions:make-package]] 'temp :use nil) <r>#<PACKAGE "TEMP"></r>
([[CL:Functions:use-package]] 'temp) <r>T </r>
([[CL:Functions:intern]] "TEMP-SYM" 'temp) <r>TEMP::TEMP-SYM
NIL </r>
([[CL:Functions:find-symbol]] "TEMP-SYM") <r>NIL
NIL </r>
(export ([[CL:Functions:find-symbol]] "TEMP-SYM" 'temp) 'temp) <r>T </r>
([[CL:Functions:find-symbol]] "TEMP-SYM") <r>TEMP-SYM
:INHERITED </r>
</blockquote>

====Side Effects====
The package system is modified.

====Affected By====
//[[CL:Glossary:accessible|Accessible]]// //[[CL:Glossary:symbols]]//.

====Exceptional Situations====
If any of the //symbols// is not //[[CL:Glossary:accessible]]// at all in //package//, an error of type **[[CL:Types:package-error]]** is signaled that is //[[CL:Glossary:correctable]]// by permitting the //[[CL:Glossary:user]]// to interactively specify whether that //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// should be //[[CL:Glossary:import|imported]]//.
