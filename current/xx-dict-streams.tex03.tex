====== System Class CONCATENATED-STREAM ======

====Class Precedence List====
**concatenated-stream**, **[[CL:Types:stream]]**, **[[CL:Types:t]]**

====Description====
A //[[CL:Glossary:concatenated stream]]// is an //[[CL:Glossary:input]]// //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]// which is a //[[CL:Glossary:composite stream]]// of zero or more other //[[CL:Glossary:input]]// //[[CL:Glossary:streams]]//, such that the sequence of data which can be read from the //[[CL:Glossary:concatenated stream]]// is the same as the concatenation of the sequences of data which could be read from each of the constituent //[[CL:Glossary:streams]]//.

Input from a //[[CL:Glossary:concatenated stream]]// is taken from the first of the associated //[[CL:Glossary:input streams]]// until it reaches //[[CL:Glossary:end of file]]//; then that //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]// is discarded, and subsequent input is taken from the next //[[CL:Glossary:input stream]]//, and so on.

An //[[CL:Glossary:end of file]]// on the associated //[[CL:Glossary:input streams]]// is always managed invisibly by the //[[CL:Glossary:concatenated stream]]//---the only time a client of a //[[CL:Glossary:concatenated stream]]// sees an //[[CL:Glossary:end of file]]// is when an attempt is made to obtain data from the //[[CL:Glossary:concatenated stream]]// but it has no remaining //[[CL:Glossary:input streams]]// from which to obtain such data.
