====== Macro IN-PACKAGE ======

====Syntax====
  * **in-package** //name// â†’ //package//

====Arguments and Values====
  * //name// - a //[[CL:Glossary:package name designator]]//; not evaluated.
  * //package// - the //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// named by //name//.

====Description====
Causes the the //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// named by //name// to become the //[[CL:Glossary:current package]]// - that is, the //[[CL:Glossary:value]]// of **[[CL:Variables:star-package-star|*package*]]**. If no such //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// already exists, an error of type **[[CL:Types:package-error]]** is signaled.

Everything **in-package** does is also performed at compile time if the call appears as a //[[CL:Glossary:top level form]]//.

====Examples====
None.

====Side Effects====
The **[[CL:Variables:star-package-star|*package*]]** //[[CL:Glossary:variable]]// is assigned. If the **in-package** //[[CL:Glossary:form]]// is a //[[CL:Glossary:top level form]]//, this assignment also occurs at compile time.

====Affected By====
None.

====Exceptional Situations====
An error of type **[[CL:Types:package-error]]** is signaled if the specified //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// does not exist.

====See Also====
  * **[[CL:Variables:star-package-star|Variable *PACKAGE*]]**
