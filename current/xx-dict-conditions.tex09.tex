====== Condition Type STORAGE-CONDITION ======

====Class Precedence List==== **[[CL:Types:storage-condition]]**, **[[CL:Types:serious-condition]]**, **[[CL:Types:condition]]**, **[[CL:Types:t]]**

====Description====

The type **[[CL:Types:storage-condition]]** consists of serious conditions that relate to problems with memory management that are potentially due to //[[CL:Glossary:implementation-dependent]]// limits rather than semantic errors in //[[CL:Glossary:conforming programs]]//, and that typically warrant entry to the debugger if not handled. Depending on the details of the //[[CL:Glossary:implementation]]//, these might include such problems as stack overflow, memory region overflow, and storage exhausted.

====Notes====

While some \clisp\ operations might signal //[[CL:Glossary:storage-condition]]// because they are defined to create //[[CL:Glossary:object|objects]]//, it is unspecified whether operations that are not defined to create //[[CL:Glossary:object|objects]]// create them anyway and so might also signal **[[CL:Types:storage-condition]]**. Likewise, the evaluator itself might create //[[CL:Glossary:object|objects]]// and so might signal **[[CL:Types:storage-condition]]**. (The natural assumption might be that such //[[CL:Glossary:object]]// creation is naturally inefficient, but even that is //[[CL:Glossary:implementation-dependent]]//.) In general, the entire question of how storage allocation is done is //[[CL:Glossary:implementation-dependent]]//, and so any operation might signal **[[CL:Types:storage-condition]]** at any time. Because such a //[[CL:Glossary:condition]]// is indicative of a limitation of the //[[CL:Glossary:implementation]]// or of the //[[CL:Glossary:image]]// rather than an error in a //[[CL:Glossary:program]]//, //[[CL:Glossary:object|objects]]// of type **[[CL:Types:storage-condition]]** are not of type **[[CL:Types:error]]**.
