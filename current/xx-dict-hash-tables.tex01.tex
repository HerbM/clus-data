====== System Class HASH-TABLE ======

====Class Precedence List====
**hash-table**, **[[CL:Types:t]]**

====Description====
//[[CL:Glossary:hash table|Hash tables]]// provide a way of mapping any //[[CL:Glossary:object]]// (a //[[CL:Glossary:key]]//) to an associated //[[CL:Glossary:object]]// (a //[[CL:Glossary:value]]//).

====See Also====
  * {\secref\HashTableConcepts}
  * {\secref\PrintingOtherObjects}

====Notes====
The intent is that this mapping be implemented by a hashing mechanism, such as that described in Section 6.4 "Hashing" of //The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 3// (pages 506-549) by Donald e. Knuth. In spite of this intent, no //[[CL:Glossary:conforming implementation]]// is required to use any particular technique to implement the mapping.
