====== Special Operator GO ======

====Syntax====

\DefspecNoReturn go {tag}

====Arguments and Values====

//tag// - a //[[CL:Glossary:go tag]]//.

====Description====

**[[CL:Special Operators:go]]** transfers control to the point in the body of an enclosing **[[CL:Special Operators:tagbody]]** form labeled by a tag **[[CL:Functions:eql]]** to //tag//.

If there is no such //tag// in the body, the bodies of lexically containing **[[CL:Special Operators:tagbody]]** //[[CL:Glossary:form|forms]]// (if any) are examined as well. If several tags are **[[CL:Functions:eql]]** to //tag//, control is transferred to whichever matching //tag// is contained in the innermost **[[CL:Special Operators:tagbody]]** form that contains the **[[CL:Special Operators:go]]**. The consequences are undefined if there is no matching //tag// lexically visible to the point of the **[[CL:Special Operators:go]]**.

The transfer of control initiated by **[[CL:Special Operators:go]]** is performed as described in \secref\TransferOfControl.

====Examples==== <blockquote> (tagbody ([[CL:Macros:defparameter]] val 2) (go lp) (incf val 3) lp (incf val 4)) → NIL val → 6 </blockquote>



The following is in error because there is a normal exit of the **[[CL:Special Operators:tagbody]]** before the **[[CL:Special Operators:go]]** is executed.

<blockquote> (let ((a nil)) (tagbody t ([[CL:Macros:defparameter]] a #'(lambda () (go t)))) (funcall a)) </blockquote>

The following is in error because the **[[CL:Special Operators:tagbody]]** is passed over before the **[[CL:Special Operators:go]]** //[[CL:Glossary:form]]// is executed.

<blockquote> (funcall (block nil (tagbody a (return #'(lambda () (go a)))))) </blockquote>

====Affected By====

None.

====Exceptional Situations====

None.

====Notes====
