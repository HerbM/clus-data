====== Variable *PRINT-PPRINT-DISPATCH* ======

====Value Type====
a //[[CL:Glossary:pprint dispatch table]]//.

====Initial Value====
//[[CL:Glossary:implementation-dependent]]//, but the initial entries all use a special class of priorities that have the property that they are less than every priority that can be specified using **[[CL:Functions:set-pprint-dispatch]]**, so that the initial contents of any entry can be overridden.

====Description====
The //[[CL:Glossary:pprint dispatch table]]// which currently controls the //[[CL:Glossary:pretty printer]]//.

====Examples====
None.

====See Also====
**[[CL:Variables:*print-pretty*]]**, {\secref\PPrintDispatchTables}

====Notes====
The intent is that the initial //[[CL:Glossary:value]]// of this //[[CL:Glossary:variable]]// should cause `traditional' //[[CL:Glossary:pretty printing]]// of //[[CL:Glossary:code]]//.

In general, however, you can put a value in **[[CL:Variables:*print-pprint-dispatch*]]** that makes pretty-printed output look exactly like non-pretty-printed output.

Setting **[[CL:Variables:*print-pretty*]]** to //[[CL:Glossary:true]]// just causes the functions contained in the //[[CL:Glossary:current pprint dispatch table]]// to have priority over normal **[[CL:Functions:print-object]]** methods; it has no magic way of enforcing that those functions actually produce pretty output. For details, see section {\secref\PPrintDispatchTables}.
