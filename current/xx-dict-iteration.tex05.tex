====== Local Macro LOOP-FINISH ======

====Syntax====
  * **loop-finish**

====Description====
The **loop-finish** macro can be used lexically within an extended **[[CL:Macros:loop]]** //[[CL:Glossary:form]]// to terminate that //[[CL:Glossary:form]]// "normally." That is, it transfers control to the loop epilogue of the lexically innermost extended **[[CL:Macros:loop]]** //[[CL:Glossary:form]]//. This permits execution of any **[[CL:Macros:finally]]** clause (for effect) and the return of any accumulated result.

====Examples====
The below example terminates the loop, but returns the accumulated count. 

<blockquote> 
(loop for i in '(1 2 3 stop-here 4 5 6) 
      when ([[CL:Functions:symbolp]] i) 
        do (loop-finish)
      count i) → 3
</blockquote>

This loop is equivalent to: 
<blockquote> 
(loop for i in '(1 2 3 stop-here 4 5 6)
      until ([[CL:Functions:symbolp]] i) 
      count i) → 3
</blockquote>


While **loop-finish** can be used can be used in a variety of situations, it is really most needed in a situation where a need to exit is detected at other than the loop's "top level" (where **until** or **when** often work just as well), or where some computation must occur between the point where a need to exit is detected and the point where the exit actually occurs. For example:

<blockquote>
([[CL:Macros:defun]] tokenize-sentence (string) 
  ([[CL:Special Operators:macrolet]] ((add-word (wvar svar) 
              `([[CL:Macros:when]] ,wvar 
                 ([[CL:Macros:push]] ([[CL:Functions:coerce]] ([[CL:Functions:nreverse]] ,wvar) '[[CL:Types:string]]) ,svar) 
                 ([[CL:Macros:setf]] ,wvar [[CL:Constant Variables:nil]]))))
    (loop with word = '() and sentence = '() and endpos = [[CL:Constant Variables:nil]] 
          for i below ([[CL:Functions:length]] string) 
          do ([[CL:Special Operators:let]] ((char ([[CL:Functions:aref]] string i)))
               ([[CL:Macros:case]] char 
                 (#\Space (add-word word sentence))
                 (#\. ([[CL:Macros:setf]] endpos ([[CL:Functions:math-one-plus|1+]] i)) (loop-finish))
                 (otherwise ([[CL:Functions:push]] char word))))
          finally (add-word word sentence) 
                  ([[CL:Macros:return]] ([[CL:Functions:values]] ([[CL:Functions:nreverse]] sentence) endpos))))) <r>TOKENIZE-SENTENCE</r>
(tokenize-sentence "this is a sentence. this is another sentence.") <r>("this" "is" "a" "sentence")
19</r>
(tokenize-sentence "this is a sentence") <r>("this" "is" "a" "sentence")
NIL</r>
</blockquote>

====Side Effects====
Transfers control.

====Affected By====
None.

====Exceptional Situations====
Whether or not **loop-finish** is //[[CL:Glossary:fbound]]// in the //[[CL:Glossary:global environment]]// is //[[CL:Glossary:implementation-dependent]]//; however, the restrictions on redefinition and //[[CL:Glossary:shadow|shadowing]]// of **loop-finish** are the same as for //[[CL:Glossary:symbol|symbols]]// in the **COMMON-LISP** //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// which are //[[CL:Glossary:fbound]]// in the //[[CL:Glossary:global environment]]//. The consequences of attempting to use **loop-finish** outside of **[[CL:Macros:loop]]** are undefined.
