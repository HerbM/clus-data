====== Macro WITH-OPEN-STREAM ======

====Syntax====
  * **with-open-stream** (//var// //stream//) //declaration//''*'' //form//''*'' â†’ //result//''*''

====Arguments and Values====
  * //var// - a //[[CL:Glossary:variable]]// //[[CL:Glossary:name]]//.
  * //stream// - a //[[CL:Glossary:form]]//; evaluated to produce a //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]//.
  * //declaration// - a **[[CL:Symbols:declare]]** //[[CL:Glossary:expression]]//; not evaluated.
  * //forms// - an //[[CL:Glossary:implicit progn]]//.
  * //results// - the //[[CL:Glossary:values]]// returned by the //forms//.

====Description====
**with-open-stream** performs a series of operations on //stream//, returns a value, and then closes the //stream//.

//var// is bound to the value of //stream//, and then //forms// are executed as an //[[CL:Glossary:implicit progn]]//. //stream// is automatically closed on exit from **with-open-stream**, no matter whether the exit is normal or abnormal.

The //stream// has //[[CL:Glossary:dynamic extent]]//; its //[[CL:Glossary:extent]]// ends when the //[[CL:Glossary:form]]// is exited.

The consequences are undefined if an attempt is made to //[[CL:Glossary:assign]]// the the //[[CL:Glossary:variable]]// //var// with the //forms//.

====Examples====
<blockquote> 
(with-open-stream (s ([[CL:Functions:make-string-input-stream]] "1 2 3 4")) 
  ([[CL:Functions:math-add|+]] ([[CL:Functions:read]] s) 
     ([[CL:Functions:read]] s) 
     ([[CL:Functions:read]] s))) <r>6 </r>
</blockquote>

====Side Effects====
The //stream// is closed (upon exit).

====Affected By====
None.

====Exceptional Situations====
None.

====See Also====
  * **[[CL:Functions:close|Function CLOSE]]**

====Notes====
