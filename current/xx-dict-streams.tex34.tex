====== Macro WITH-OPEN-STREAM ======

====Syntax====
\DefmacWithValuesNewline with-open-stream {\paren{var stream} \starparam{declaration} \starparam{form}} {\starparam{result}}

====Arguments and Values====
//var// - a //[[CL:Glossary:variable]]// //[[CL:Glossary:name]]//.

//stream// - a //[[CL:Glossary:form]]//; evaluated to produce a //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]//.

//declaration// - a \misc{declare} //[[CL:Glossary:expression]]//; \noeval.

//forms// - an //[[CL:Glossary:implicit progn]]//.

//results// - the //[[CL:Glossary:values]]// returned by the //forms//.

====Description====
**[[CL:Macros:with-open-stream]]** performs a series of operations on //stream//, returns a value, and then closes the //stream//.

//Var// is bound to the value of //stream//, and then //forms// are executed as an //[[CL:Glossary:implicit progn]]//. //stream// is automatically closed on exit from **[[CL:Macros:with-open-stream]]**, no matter whether the exit is normal or abnormal.

The //stream// has //[[CL:Glossary:dynamic extent]]//; its //[[CL:Glossary:extent]]// ends when the //[[CL:Glossary:form]]// is exited.

The consequences are undefined if an attempt is made to //[[CL:Glossary:assign]]// the the //[[CL:Glossary:variable]]// //var// with the //forms//.

====Examples====
<blockquote> (with-open-stream (s (make-string-input-stream "1 2 3 4")) (+ (read s) (read s) (read s))) â†’ 6 </blockquote>

====Side Effects====
The //stream// is closed (upon exit).

====Affected By====
None.

====Exceptional Situations====
None.

====See Also====
**[[CL:Functions:close]]**

====Notes====
None.
