====== Function GET-OUTPUT-STREAM-STRING ======

====Syntax====
  * **get-output-stream-string** //string-output-stream// â†’ //string//

====Arguments and Values====
  * //string-output-stream// - a //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]//.
  * //string// - a //[[CL:Glossary:string]]//.

====Description====
Returns a //[[CL:Glossary:string]]// containing, in order, all the //[[CL:Glossary:character|characters]]// that have been output to //string-output-stream//. This operation clears any //[[CL:Glossary:character|characters]]// on //string-output-stream//, so the //string// contains only those //[[CL:Glossary:character|characters]]// which have been output since the last call to **[[CL:Functions:get-output-stream-string]]** or since the creation of the //string-output-stream//, whichever occurred most recently.

====Examples==== 
<blockquote> 
([[CL:Macros:defparameter]] *a-stream* ([[CL:Functions:make-string-output-stream]])) <r>*A-STREAM*</r>
([[CL:Macros:defparameter]] *a-string* "abcdefghijklm") <r>*A-STRING*</r>
*a-stream* <r>"abcdefghijklm" </r>
([[CL:Functions:write-string]] *a-string* *a-stream*) <r>"abcdefghijklm" </r>
(get-output-stream-string *a-stream*) <r>"abcdefghijklm" </r>
(get-output-stream-string *a-stream*) <r>""</r>
</blockquote>

====Side Effects====
The //string-output-stream// is cleared.

====Affected By====
None.

====Exceptional Situations====
The consequences are undefined if //stream-output-string// is //[[CL:Glossary:closed]]//.

The consequences are undefined if //string-output-stream// is a //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]// that was not produced by **[[CL:Functions:make-string-output-stream]]**.

The consequences are undefined if //string-output-stream// was created implicitly by **[[CL:Macros:with-output-to-string]]** or **[[CL:Functions:format]]**.
