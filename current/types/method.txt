====Class Precedence List==== 
**method**, **[[CL:Types:t]]**

====Description====
A //[[CL:Glossary:method]]// is an //[[CL:Glossary:object]]// that represents a modular part of the behavior of a //[[CL:Glossary:generic function]]//.

A //[[CL:Glossary:method]]// contains //[[CL:Glossary:code]]// to implement the //[[CL:Glossary:method]]//'s behavior, a sequence of //[[CL:Glossary:parameter specializers]]// that specify when the given //[[CL:Glossary:method]]// is applicable, and a sequence of //[[CL:Glossary:qualifiers]]// that is used by the //[[CL:Glossary:method combination]]// facility to distinguish among //[[CL:Glossary:methods]]//. Each required parameter of each //[[CL:Glossary:method]]// has an associated //[[CL:Glossary:parameter specializer]]//, and the //[[CL:Glossary:method]]// will be invoked only on arguments that satisfy its //[[CL:Glossary:parameter specializers]]//.

The //[[CL:Glossary:method combination]]// facility controls the selection of //[[CL:Glossary:methods]]//, the order in which they are run, and the values that are returned by the generic function. The Common Lisp Object System offers a default //[[CL:Glossary:method combination]]// type and provides a facility for declaring new types of //[[CL:Glossary:method combination]]//.
