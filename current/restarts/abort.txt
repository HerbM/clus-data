====== Restart ABORT ======

====Data Arguments Required====
None.

====Description====
The intent of the **abort** restart is to allow return to the innermost "command level." Implementors are encouraged to make sure that there is always a restart named **[[CL:Functions:abort]]** around any user code so that user code can call **[[CL:Functions:abort]]** at any time and expect something reasonable to happen; exactly what the reasonable thing is may vary somewhat. Typically, in an interactive listener, the invocation of **[[CL:Functions:abort]]** returns to the //[[CL:Glossary:Lisp reader]]// phase of the //[[CL:Glossary:Lisp read-eval-print loop]]//, though in some batch or multi-processing situations there may be situations in which having it kill the running process is more appropriate.
