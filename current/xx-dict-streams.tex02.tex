====== System Class BROADCAST-STREAM ======

====Class Precedence List====
**broadcast-stream**, **[[CL:Types:stream]]**, **[[CL:Types:t]]**

====Description====
A //[[CL:Glossary:broadcast stream]]// is an //[[CL:Glossary:output]]// //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]// which has associated with it a set of zero or more //[[CL:Glossary:output]]// //[[CL:Glossary:streams]]// such that any output sent to the //[[CL:Glossary:broadcast stream]]// gets passed on as output to each of the associated //[[CL:Glossary:output]]// //[[CL:Glossary:streams]]//. (If a //[[CL:Glossary:broadcast stream]]// has no //[[CL:Glossary:component streams]]//, then all output to the //[[CL:Glossary:broadcast stream]]// is discarded.)

The set of operations that may be performed on a //[[CL:Glossary:broadcast stream]]// is the intersection of those for its associated //[[CL:Glossary:output]]// //[[CL:Glossary:streams]]//.

Some output operations (//e.g.// **[[CL:Functions:fresh-line]]**) return //[[CL:Glossary:values]]// based on the state of the //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]// at the time of the operation.

Since these //[[CL:Glossary:values]]// might differ for each of the //[[CL:Glossary:component streams]]//, it is necessary to describe their return value specifically:

  * **[[CL:Functions:stream-element-type]]** returns the value from the last component stream, or **[[CL:Types:t]]** if there are no component streams.
  * **[[CL:Functions:fresh-line]]** returns the value from the last component stream, or **[[CL:Constant Variables:nil]]** if there are no component streams.
  * The functions **[[CL:Functions:file-length]]**, **[[CL:Functions:file-position]]**, **[[CL:Functions:file-string-length]]**, and **[[CL:Functions:stream-external-format]]** return the value from the last component stream; if there are no component streams, **[[CL:Functions:file-length]]** and **[[CL:Functions:file-position]]** return ''0'', **[[CL:Functions:file-string-length]]** returns ''1'', and **[[CL:Functions:stream-external-format]]** returns **'':default''**.
  * The functions **[[CL:Functions:streamp]]** and **[[CL:Functions:output-stream-p]]** always return //[[CL:Glossary:true]]// for //[[CL:Glossary:broadcast streams]]//.
  * The functions **[[CL:Functions:open-stream-p]]** tests whether the //[[CL:Glossary:broadcast stream]]// is //[[CL:Glossary:open]]//, not whether its component streams are //[[CL:Glossary:open]]//.
  * The functions **[[CL:Functions:input-stream-p]]** and //[[CL:Glossary:interactive-stream-p]]// return an //[[CL:Glossary:implementation-defined]]//, //[[CL:Glossary:generalized boolean]]// value.
  * For the input operations **[[CL:Functions:clear-input]]** **[[CL:Functions:listen]]**, **[[CL:Functions:peek-char]]**, **[[CL:Functions:read-byte]]**, **[[CL:Functions:read-char-no-hang]]**, **[[CL:Functions:read-char]]**, **[[CL:Functions:read-line]]**, and **[[CL:Functions:unread-char]]**, the consequences are undefined if the indicated operation is performed. However, an //[[CL:Glossary:implementation]]// is permitted to define such a behavior as an //[[CL:Glossary:implementation-dependent]]// extension.

For any output operations not having their return values explicitly specified above or elsewhere in this document, it is defined that the //[[CL:Glossary:values]]// returned by such an operation are the //[[CL:Glossary:values]]// resulting from performing the operation on the last of its //[[CL:Glossary:component streams]]//; the //[[CL:Glossary:values]]// resulting from performing the operation on all preceding //[[CL:Glossary:streams]]// are discarded. If there are no //[[CL:Glossary:component streams]]//, the value is //[[CL:Glossary:implementation-dependent]]//.
