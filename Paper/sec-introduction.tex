\section{Introduction}

The current state of \cl{} documentation in general is something I do not consider satisfying.

The bodies of documentation are often incomplete and out-of-sync - they do not reflect the current state of a particular library. They tend to be dated and in need of modernization. They contain errors and mistakes and are either unmaintained or non-editable. They are non-hyperlinked and do not refer to each other in a way that makes it easy to navigate between them. They are scattered across the web and depend on multiple separated web hostings, increasing the risk of losing access to them if a particular server containing their data fails.

I see the multiple issues this state of matters causes to \cl{} programmers, newbies and seasoned Lispers alike. The experienced programmers are most likely used to these pieces of documentation and that fact might might minimize the losses they suffer, but, from my personal experience, newcomers are often lost and disoriented because of the documentation's general fragmentation, lack of maintenance, a poor visual appeal and a lack of an obvious way to fix and contribute this state of matters for whoever has the time and will to improve these matters themselves.

For the sake of justice - I must remark that the things I have mentioned above do not disqualify said documentation from being useful and invaluable for many Common Lisp programmers. The manuals specifying the language, its extensions and many libraries are good enough to work with and the multitude of Common Lisp applications proves this point - but I consider this state of matters to be improvable.

This paper contains an idea and requirements for an improvement of the state of Common Lisp documentation. It also contains descriptions of an implementation of this idea, the sources I have used, the full technological stack I have used so far, the problems and issues I have encountered, the benefits and disadvantages of my approach and the plans I have for the future extension and expansion of the aforementioned work.
