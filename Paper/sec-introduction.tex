\section{Introduction}

The current state of Common Lisp documentation in general is something I do not consider satisfying.

The bodies of documentation are often incomplete and out-of-sync - they do not reflect the current state of a particular library. They tend to be dated and in need of modernization. They contain errors and mistakes and are either unmaintained or non-editable. They are non-hyperlinked and do not refer to each other in a way that makes it easy to navigate between them. They are scattered across the web and depend on multiple separated web hostings, increasing the risk of losing access to them if a particular server containing their data fails.

For the sake of justice - I must remark that the things I have mentioned above do not disqualify said documentation from being useful and invaluable for many Common Lisp programmers. The manuals specifying the language, its extensions and many libraries are good enough to work with and the multitude of Common Lisp applications proves this point - but I consider this state of matters to be improvable.

This paper contains an idea and requirements for an improvement of the state of Common Lisp documentation. It also contains a description of an implementation of this idea, also mentioning the technological stack I have used so far, the problems I have encountered, the benefits and disadvantages of my approach and the plans I have for the future extension and expansion of the aforementioned work.
