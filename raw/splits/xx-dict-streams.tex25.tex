====== Function WRITE-SEQUENCE ======

====Syntax====

**{write-sequence} {sequence stream** //\key} start end// → //sequence//

//sequence// - a //[[CL:Glossary:sequence]]//.

//stream// - an //[[CL:Glossary:output]]// //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]//.

//start//, //end// - //[[CL:Glossary:bounding index designators]]// of //sequence//. \Defaults{//start// and //end//}{''0'' and **[[CL:Constant Variables:nil]]**}

====Description====

**[[CL:Functions:write-sequence]]** writes the //[[CL:Glossary:element|elements]]// of the subsequence of //sequence// //[[CL:Glossary:bounded]]// by //start// and //end// to //stream//.

====Examples====

<blockquote> (write-sequence "bookworms" *standard-output* :end 4)
▷ book → "bookworms" </blockquote>

====Side Effects====

Modifies //stream//.

====Affected By====

None.

====Exceptional Situations====

Should be prepared to signal an error of type type-error if //sequence// is not a //[[CL:Glossary:proper sequence]]//. Should signal an error of type type-error if //start// is not a non-negative //[[CL:Glossary:integer]]//. Should signal an error of type type-error if //end// is not a non-negative //[[CL:Glossary:integer]]// or **[[CL:Constant Variables:nil]]**.

Might signal an error of type **[[CL:Types:type-error]]** if an //[[CL:Glossary:element]]// of the //[[CL:Glossary:bounded]]// //[[CL:Glossary:sequence]]// is not a member of the //[[CL:Glossary:stream element type]]// of the //stream//.

====Notes====

**[[CL:Functions:write-sequence]]** is identical in effect to iterating over the indicated subsequence and writing one //[[CL:Glossary:element]]// at a time to //stream//, but may be more efficient than the equivalent loop. An efficient implementation is more likely to exist for the case where the //sequence// is a //[[CL:Glossary:vector]]// with the same //[[CL:Glossary:element type]]// as the //stream//.
