====== Function CLOSE ======

====Syntax====

**close {stream** //\key} abort// → //result//

====Arguments and Values====

//stream// - a //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]// (either //[[CL:Glossary:open]]// or //[[CL:Glossary:closed]]//).

//abort// - a //[[CL:Glossary:generalized boolean]]//. The default is //[[CL:Glossary:false]]//.

//result// - \t\ if the //stream// was //[[CL:Glossary:open]]// at the time it was received as an //[[CL:Glossary:argument]]//, or //[[CL:Glossary:implementation-dependent]]// otherwise.

====Description====

**[[CL:Functions:close]]** closes //stream//. Closing a //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]// means that it may no longer be used in input or output operations. The act of //[[CL:Glossary:closing]]// a //[[CL:Glossary:file stream]]// ends the association between the //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]// and its associated //[[CL:Glossary:file]]//; the transaction with the //[[CL:Glossary:file system]]// is terminated, and input/output may no longer be performed on the //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]//.

If //abort// is //[[CL:Glossary:true]]//, an attempt is made to clean up any side effects of having created //stream//. If //stream// performs output to a file that was created when the //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]// was created, the file is deleted and any previously existing file is not superseded.

It is permissible to close an already closed //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]//, but in that case the //result// is //[[CL:Glossary:implementation-dependent]]//.

After //stream// is closed, it is still possible to perform the following query operations upon it:

**[[CL:Functions:streamp]]**, **[[CL:Functions:pathname]]**, **[[CL:Functions:truename]]**, **[[CL:Functions:merge-pathnames]]**, **[[CL:Functions:pathname-host]]**, **[[CL:Functions:pathname-device]]**, **[[CL:Functions:pathname-directory]]**, **[[CL:Functions:pathname-name]]**, **[[CL:Functions:pathname-type]]**, **[[CL:Functions:pathname-version]]**, **[[CL:Functions:namestring]]**, **[[CL:Functions:file-namestring]]**, **[[CL:Functions:directory-namestring]]**, **[[CL:Functions:host-namestring]]**, **[[CL:Functions:enough-namestring]]**, **[[CL:Functions:open]]**, **[[CL:Functions:probe-file]]**, and **[[CL:Functions:directory]]**.

The effect of **[[CL:Functions:close]]** on a //[[CL:Glossary:constructed stream]]// is to close the argument //stream// only. There is no effect on the //[[CL:Glossary:constituents]]// of //[[CL:Glossary:composite streams]]//.

For a //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]// created with **[[CL:Functions:make-string-output-stream]]**, the result of **[[CL:Functions:get-output-stream-string]]** is unspecified after **[[CL:Functions:close]]**.


====Examples====

<blockquote> ([[CL:Macros:defparameter]] s (make-broadcast-stream)) → #<BROADCAST-STREAM> (close s) → T (output-stream-p s) → //[[CL:Glossary:true]]// </blockquote>

====Side Effects====

The //stream// is //[[CL:Glossary:closed]]// (if necessary). If //abort// is //[[CL:Glossary:true]]// and the //stream// is an //[[CL:Glossary:output]]// //[[CL:Glossary:file stream]]//, its associated //[[CL:Glossary:file]]// might be deleted.

====Affected By====

None.

====Exceptional Situations====

None.
