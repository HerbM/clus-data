====== Function READ-CHAR ======

====Syntax====

\DefunWithValues {read-char} {''&optional'' input-stream eof-error-p eof-value recursive-p} {char}

====Arguments and Values====

//input-stream// - an //[[CL:Glossary:input]]// //[[CL:Glossary:stream designator]]//. The default is //[[CL:Glossary:standard input]]//.

//eof-error-p// - a //[[CL:Glossary:generalized boolean]]//. The default is //[[CL:Glossary:true]]//.

//eof-value// - an //[[CL:Glossary:object]]//. The default is **[[CL:Constant Variables:nil]]**.

//recursive-p// - a //[[CL:Glossary:generalized boolean]]//. The default is //[[CL:Glossary:false]]//.

//char// - a //[[CL:Glossary:character]]// or the //eof-value//.

====Description====

**[[CL:Functions:read-char]]** returns the next //[[CL:Glossary:character]]// from //input-stream//.

When //input-stream// is an //echo stream//, the character is echoed on //input-stream// the first time the character is

seen. Characters that are not echoed by **[[CL:Functions:read-char]]** are those that were put there by **[[CL:Functions:unread-char]]** and hence are assumed to have been echoed already by a previous call to **[[CL:Functions:read-char]]**.

{'' ''}{\ExplainRecursiveP}

If an //[[CL:Glossary:end of file]]// occurs and //eof-error-p// is //[[CL:Glossary:false]]//, //eof-value// is returned.

====Examples==== <blockquote> (with-input-from-string (is "0123") (do ((c (read-char is) (read-char is nil 'the-end))) ((not (characterp c))) (format t "~S " c)))
▷ #\\0 #\\1 #\\2 #\\3 → NIL </blockquote>

====Affected By====

**[[CL:Variables:*standard-input*]]**, **[[CL:Variables:*terminal-io*]]**.

====Exceptional Situations====

If an //[[CL:Glossary:end of file]]// occurs before a character can be read, and //eof-error-p// is //[[CL:Glossary:true]]//, an error of type **[[CL:Types:end-of-file]]** is signaled.

====Notes====

The corresponding output function is **[[CL:Functions:write-char]]**.
