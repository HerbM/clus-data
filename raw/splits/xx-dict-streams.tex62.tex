====== Variable *TERMINAL-IO* ======

====Value Type====

a //[[CL:Glossary:bidirectional]]// //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]//.

====Initial Value====

//[[CL:Glossary:implementation-dependent]]//, but it must be an //[[CL:Glossary:open]]// //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]// that is not a //[[CL:Glossary:generalized synonym stream]]// to an //[[CL:Glossary:I/O customization variables]]// but that might be a //[[CL:Glossary:generalized synonym stream]]// to the //[[CL:Glossary:value]]// of some //[[CL:Glossary:I/O customization variable]]//.

====Description====

\Thevalueof{*terminal-io*}, called //[[CL:Glossary:terminal I/O]]//, is ordinarily a //[[CL:Glossary:bidirectional]]// //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]// that connects to the user's console. Typically, writing to this //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]// would cause the output to appear on a display screen, for example, and reading from the //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]// would accept input from a keyboard. It is intended that standard input functions such as **[[CL:Functions:read]]** and **[[CL:Functions:read-char]]**, when used with this //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]//, cause echoing of the input into the output side of the //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]//. The means by which this is accomplished are //[[CL:Glossary:implementation-dependent]]//.

The effect of changing \thevalueof{*terminal-io*}, either by //[[CL:Glossary:binding]]// or //[[CL:Glossary:assignment]]//, is //[[CL:Glossary:implementation-defined]]//.

====Examples====

<blockquote> (progn (prin1 'foo) (prin1 'bar *terminal-io*))
▷ FOOBAR → BAR (with-output-to-string (*standard-output*) (prin1 'foo) (prin1 'bar *terminal-io*))
▷ BAR → "FOO" </blockquote>

====Affected By====

None.
