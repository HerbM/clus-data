====Class Precedence List==== **[[CL:Types:symbol]]**, **[[CL:Types:t]]**

====Description====

//[[CL:Glossary:Symbols]]// are used for their //[[CL:Glossary:object]]// identity to name various entities in \clisp, including (but not limited to) linguistic entities such as //[[CL:Glossary:variables]]// and //[[CL:Glossary:functions]]//.

//[[CL:Glossary:Symbols]]// can be collected together into //[[CL:Glossary:packages]]//. A //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// is said to be //[[CL:Glossary:interned]]// in a //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// if it is //[[CL:Glossary:accessible]]// in that //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//; the same //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// can be //[[CL:Glossary:interned]]// in more than one //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//. If a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// is not //[[CL:Glossary:interned]]// in any //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//, it is called //[[CL:Glossary:uninterned]]//.

An //[[CL:Glossary:interned]]// //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// is uniquely identifiable by its //[[CL:Glossary:name]]// from any //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// in which it is //[[CL:Glossary:accessible]]//.

//[[CL:Glossary:Symbols]]// have the following attributes.

For historical reasons, these are sometimes referred to as //[[CL:Glossary:cells]]//, although the actual internal representation of //[[CL:Glossary:symbols]]// and their attributes is //[[CL:Glossary:implementation-dependent]]//.

\beginlist

\itemitem{\b{Name}}

The //[[CL:Glossary:name]]// of a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// is a //[[CL:Glossary:string]]// used to identify the //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]//. Every //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// has a //[[CL:Glossary:name]]//,

and the consequences are undefined if that //[[CL:Glossary:name]]// is altered.

The //[[CL:Glossary:name]]// is used as part of the external, printed representation of the //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]//; see section {\secref\CharacterSyntax}. The //[[CL:Glossary:function]]// **[[CL:Functions:symbol-name]]** returns the //[[CL:Glossary:name]]// of a given //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]//.

A //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// may have any //[[CL:Glossary:character]]// in its //[[CL:Glossary:name]]//.

\itemitem{\b{Package}}

The //[[CL:Glossary:object]]// in this //[[CL:Glossary:cell]]// is called the //[[CL:Glossary:home package]]// of the //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]//. If the //[[CL:Glossary:home package]]// is **[[CL:Constant Variables:nil]]**, the //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// is sometimes said to have no //[[CL:Glossary:home package]]//.

When a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// is first created, it has no //[[CL:Glossary:home package]]//. When it is first //[[CL:Glossary:interned]]//, the //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// in which it is initially //[[CL:Glossary:interned]]// becomes its //[[CL:Glossary:home package]]//. The //[[CL:Glossary:home package]]// of a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// can be //[[CL:Glossary:accessed]]// by using the function **[[CL:Functions:symbol-package]]**.

If a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// is //[[CL:Glossary:uninterned]]// from the //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// which is its //[[CL:Glossary:home package]]//, its //[[CL:Glossary:home package]]// is set to **[[CL:Constant Variables:nil]]**. Depending on whether there is another //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// in which the //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// is //[[CL:Glossary:interned]]//, the symbol might or might not really be an //[[CL:Glossary:uninterned]]// //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]//. A //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// with no //[[CL:Glossary:home package]]// is therefore called //[[CL:Glossary:apparently uninterned]]//.

The consequences are undefined if an attempt is made to alter the //[[CL:Glossary:home package]]// of a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]//

external in \thepackage{common-lisp} or \thepackage{keyword}.

\itemitem{\b{Property list}}

The //[[CL:Glossary:property list]]// of a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// provides a mechanism for associating named attributes with that //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]//. The operations for adding and removing entries are //[[CL:Glossary:destructive]]// to the //[[CL:Glossary:property list]]//. \clisp\ provides //[[CL:Glossary:operators]]// both for direct manipulation of //[[CL:Glossary:property list]]// //[[CL:Glossary:object|objects]]// (//e.g.// see **[[CL:Functions:getf]]**, **[[CL:Functions:remf]]**, and **[[CL:Functions:symbol-plist]]**) and for implicit manipulation of a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]//'s //[[CL:Glossary:property list]]// by reference to the //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// (//e.g.// see **[[CL:Functions:get]]** and **[[CL:Functions:remprop]]**). The //[[CL:Glossary:property list]]// associated with a //[[CL:Glossary:fresh]]// //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// is initially //[[CL:Glossary:null]]//.

\itemitem{\b{Value}}

If a symbol has a value attribute, it is said to be //[[CL:Glossary:bound]]//, and that fact can be detected by the function **[[CL:Functions:boundp]]**. The //[[CL:Glossary:object]]// contained in the //[[CL:Glossary:value cell]]// of a //[[CL:Glossary:bound]]// //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// is the //[[CL:Glossary:value]]// of the //[[CL:Glossary:global variable]]// named by that //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]//, and can be //[[CL:Glossary:accessed]]// by the function **[[CL:Functions:symbol-value]]**. A //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// can be made to be //[[CL:Glossary:unbound]]// by the function **[[CL:Functions:makunbound]]**.

The consequences are undefined if an attempt is made to change the //[[CL:Glossary:value]]// of a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// that names a //[[CL:Glossary:constant variable]]//, or to make such a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// be //[[CL:Glossary:unbound]]//.

\itemitem{\b{Function}}

If a symbol has a function attribute, it is said to be //[[CL:Glossary:fbound]]//, and that fact can be detected by the function **[[CL:Functions:fboundp]]**. If the //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// is the //[[CL:Glossary:name]]// of a //[[CL:Glossary:function]]// in the //[[CL:Glossary:global environment]]//, the //[[CL:Glossary:function cell]]// contains the //[[CL:Glossary:function]]//, and can be //[[CL:Glossary:accessed]]// by the function **[[CL:Functions:symbol-function]]**. If the //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// is the //[[CL:Glossary:name]]// of either a //[[CL:Glossary:macro]]// in the //[[CL:Glossary:global environment]]// (see **[[CL:Functions:macro-function]]**) or a //[[CL:Glossary:special operator]]// (see **[[CL:Functions:special-operator-p]]**), the //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// is //[[CL:Glossary:fbound]]//, and can be //[[CL:Glossary:accessed]]// by the function **[[CL:Functions:symbol-function]]**, but the //[[CL:Glossary:object]]// which the //[[CL:Glossary:function cell]]// contains is of //[[CL:Glossary:implementation-dependent]]// //[[CL:Glossary:type]]// and purpose. A //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// can be made to be //[[CL:Glossary:funbound]]// by the function **[[CL:Functions:fmakunbound]]**.

The consequences are undefined if an attempt is made to change the //[[CL:Glossary:functional value]]// of a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// that names a //[[CL:Glossary:special form]]//.

\endlist

Operations on a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]//'s //[[CL:Glossary:value cell]]// and //[[CL:Glossary:function cell]]// are sometimes described in terms of their effect on the //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// itself, but the user should keep in mind that there is an intimate relationship between the contents of those //[[CL:Glossary:cells]]// and the //[[CL:Glossary:global variable]]// or global //[[CL:Glossary:function]]// definition, respectively.

//[[CL:Glossary:Symbols]]// are used as identifiers for //[[CL:Glossary:lexical variables]]// and lexical //[[CL:Glossary:function]]// definitions, but in that role, only their //[[CL:Glossary:object]]// identity is significant. \clisp\ provides no operation on a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// that can have any effect on a //[[CL:Glossary:lexical variable]]// or on a lexical //[[CL:Glossary:function]]// definition.
