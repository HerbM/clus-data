====== Condition Type SERIOUS-CONDITION ======

====Class Precedence List==== **[[CL:Types:serious-condition]]**, **[[CL:Types:condition]]**, **[[CL:Types:t]]**

====Description====

All //[[CL:Glossary:conditions]]// serious enough to require interactive intervention if not handled should inherit from the type **[[CL:Types:serious-condition]]**. This condition type is provided

primarily so that it may be included as a //[[CL:Glossary:superclass]]// of other //[[CL:Glossary:condition]]// //[[CL:Glossary:types]]//; it is not intended to be signaled directly.

====Notes====

Signaling a //[[CL:Glossary:serious condition]]// does not itself force entry into the debugger. However, except in the unusual situation where the programmer can assure that no harm will come from failing to //[[CL:Glossary:handle]]// a //[[CL:Glossary:serious condition]]//, such a //[[CL:Glossary:condition]]// is usually signaled with **[[CL:Functions:error]]** rather than **[[CL:Functions:signal]]** in order to assure that the program does not continue without //[[CL:Glossary:handling]]// the //[[CL:Glossary:condition]]//. (And conversely, it is conventional to use **[[CL:Functions:signal]]** rather than **[[CL:Functions:error]]** to signal conditions which are not //[[CL:Glossary:serious conditions]]//, since normally the failure to handle a non-serious condition is not reason enough for the debugger to be entered.)
