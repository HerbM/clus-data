====== Function GET-OUTPUT-STREAM-STRING ======

====Syntax====

**get-output-stream-string** //string-output-stream// → //string//

====Arguments and Values====

//string-output-stream// - a //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]//.

//string// - a //[[CL:Glossary:string]]//.

====Description====

Returns a //[[CL:Glossary:string]]// containing, in order, all the //[[CL:Glossary:characters]]// that have been output to //string-output-stream//. This operation clears any //[[CL:Glossary:characters]]// on //string-output-stream//, so the //string// contains only those //[[CL:Glossary:characters]]// which have been output since the last call to **[[CL:Functions:get-output-stream-string]]** or since the creation of the //string-output-stream//, whichever occurred most recently.

====Examples==== <blockquote> ([[CL:Macros:defparameter]] a-stream (make-string-output-stream) a-string "abcdefghijklm") → "abcdefghijklm" (write-string a-string a-stream) → "abcdefghijklm" (get-output-stream-string a-stream) → "abcdefghijklm" (get-output-stream-string a-stream) → "" </blockquote>

====Side Effects====

The //string-output-stream// is cleared.

====Affected By====

None.

====Exceptional Situations====

The consequences are undefined if //stream-output-string// is //[[CL:Glossary:closed]]//.

The consequences are undefined if //string-output-stream// is a //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]// that was not produced by **[[CL:Functions:make-string-output-stream]]**.

The consequences are undefined if //string-output-stream// was created implicitly by **[[CL:Macros:with-output-to-string]]** or **[[CL:Functions:format]]**.
