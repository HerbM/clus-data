====== Variable *DEFAULT-PATHNAME-DEFAULTS* ======

====Value Type====

a //[[CL:Glossary:pathname]]// //[[CL:Glossary:object]]//.

====Initial Value====

An //[[CL:Glossary:implementation-dependent]]// //[[CL:Glossary:pathname]]//, typically in the working directory that was current when \clisp\ was started up.

====Description====

a //[[CL:Glossary:pathname]]//, used as the default whenever a //[[CL:Glossary:function]]// needs a default //[[CL:Glossary:pathname]]// and one is not supplied.

====Examples==== <blockquote> ;; This example illustrates a possible usage for a hypothetical Lisp running on a ;; DEC TOPS-20 file system. Since pathname conventions vary between Lisp ;; implementations and host file system types, it is not possible to provide a ;; general-purpose, conforming example. *default-pathname-defaults* → #P"PS:<FRED>" (merge-pathnames (make-pathname :name "CALENDAR")) → #P"PS:<FRED>CALENDAR" (let ((*default-pathname-defaults* (pathname "<MARY>"))) (merge-pathnames (make-pathname :name "CALENDAR"))) → #P"<MARY>CALENDAR" </blockquote>

====Affected By====

The //[[CL:Glossary:implementation]]//.

====See Also====

None.

====Notes====

None.
