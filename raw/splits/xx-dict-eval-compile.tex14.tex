====== Macro DEFINE-SYMBOL-MACRO ======

====Syntax====

**define-symbol-macro** //symbol expansion// → //symbol//

====Arguments and Values====

//symbol// - a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]//.

//expansion// - a //[[CL:Glossary:form]]//.

====Description====

Provides a mechanism for globally affecting the //[[CL:Glossary:macro expansion]]// of the indicated //symbol//.

Globally establishes an expansion function for the //[[CL:Glossary:symbol macro]]// named by //symbol//.

The only guaranteed property of an expansion //[[CL:Glossary:function]]// for a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol macro]]// is that when it is applied to the //[[CL:Glossary:form]]// and the //[[CL:Glossary:environment]]// it returns the correct expansion. (In particular, it is //[[CL:Glossary:implementation-dependent]]// whether the expansion is conceptually stored in the expansion function, the //[[CL:Glossary:environment]]//, or both.)

Each global reference to //symbol// (i.e. not //[[CL:Glossary:shadowed]]// by a //[[CL:Glossary:binding]]// for a //[[CL:Glossary:variable]]// or //[[CL:Glossary:symbol macro]]// named by the same //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]//) is expanded by the normal macro expansion process; see section {\secref\SymbolsAsForms}. The expansion of a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol macro]]// is subject to further //[[CL:Glossary:macro expansion]]// in the same //[[CL:Glossary:lexical environment]]// as the //[[CL:Glossary:symbol macro]]// reference, exactly analogous to normal //[[CL:Glossary:macros]]//.


The consequences are unspecified if a \declref{special} declaration is made for //symbol// while in the scope of this definition (i.e. when it is not //[[CL:Glossary:shadowed]]// by a //[[CL:Glossary:binding]]// for a //[[CL:Glossary:variable]]// or //[[CL:Glossary:symbol macro]]// named by the same //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]//).

Any use of \specref{setq} to set the value of

the //symbol// while in the scope of this definition is treated as if it were a **[[CL:Macros:setf]]**. **[[CL:Macros:psetq]]** of //symbol// is treated as if it were a **[[CL:Macros:psetf]]**, and **[[CL:Macros:multiple-value-setq]]** is treated as if it were a \specref{setf} of **[[CL:Functions:values]]**.

A //[[CL:Glossary:binding]]// for a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol macro]]// can be //[[CL:Glossary:shadowed]]// by \specref{let} or \specref{symbol-macrolet}.

====Examples====

<blockquote> (defvar *things* (list 'alpha 'beta 'gamma)) → *THINGS*

(define-symbol-macro thing1 (first *things*)) → THING1 (define-symbol-macro thing2 (second *things*)) → THING2 (define-symbol-macro thing3 (third *things*)) → THING3

thing1 → ALPHA ([[CL:Macros:defparameter]] thing1 'ONE) → ONE *things* → (ONE BETA GAMMA) (multiple-value-[[CL:Macros:defparameter]] (thing2 thing3) (values 'two 'three)) → TWO thing3 → THREE *things* → (ONE TWO THREE)

(list thing2 (let ((thing2 2)) thing2)) → (TWO 2) </blockquote>

====Affected By====

None.

====Exceptional Situations====

If //symbol// is already defined as a //[[CL:Glossary:global variable]]//, an error of type **[[CL:Types:program-error]]** is signaled.

====See Also====

\specref{symbol-macrolet}, **[[CL:Functions:macroexpand]]**

====Notes====

None.
