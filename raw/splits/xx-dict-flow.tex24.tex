====== Special Operator GO ======

====Syntax====

\DefspecNoReturn go {tag}

====Arguments and Values====

//tag// - a //[[CL:Glossary:go tag]]//.

====Description====

\specref{go} transfers control to the point in the body of an enclosing \specref{tagbody} form labeled by a tag **[[CL:Functions:eql]]** to //tag//.

If there is no such //tag// in the body, the bodies of lexically containing \specref{tagbody} //[[CL:Glossary:forms]]// (if any) are examined as well. If several tags are **[[CL:Functions:eql]]** to //tag//, control is transferred to whichever matching //tag// is contained in the innermost \specref{tagbody} form that contains the \specref{go}. The consequences are undefined if there is no matching //tag// lexically visible to the point of the \specref{go}.

The transfer of control initiated by \specref{go} is performed as described in \secref\TransferOfControl.

====Examples==== <blockquote> (tagbody ([[CL:Macros:defparameter]] val 2) (go lp) (incf val 3) lp (incf val 4)) → NIL val → 6 </blockquote>



The following is in error because there is a normal exit of the \specref{tagbody} before the \specref{go} is executed.

<blockquote> (let ((a nil)) (tagbody t ([[CL:Macros:defparameter]] a #'(lambda () (go t)))) (funcall a)) </blockquote>

The following is in error because the \specref{tagbody} is passed over before the \specref{go} //[[CL:Glossary:form]]// is executed.

<blockquote> (funcall (block nil (tagbody a (return #'(lambda () (go a)))))) </blockquote>

====Affected By====

None.

====Exceptional Situations====

None.

====See Also====

====Notes====
