====== Restart CONTINUE ======

====Data Arguments Required====

None.

====Description====

\Therestart{continue} is generally part of protocols where there is a single "obvious" way to continue, such as in **[[CL:Functions:break]]** and **[[CL:Functions:cerror]]**. Some user-defined protocols may also wish to incorporate it for similar reasons. In general, however, it is more reliable to design a special purpose restart with a name that more directly suits the particular application.

====Examples====

<blockquote> (let ((x 3)) (handler-bind ((error #'(lambda (c) (let ((r (find-restart 'continue c))) (when r (invoke-restart r)))))) (cond ((not (floatp x)) (cerror "Try floating it." "~D is not a float." x) (float x)) (t x)))) â†’ 3.0 </blockquote>
