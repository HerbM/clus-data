====== Function PHASE ======

====Syntax====

**phase** //number// → //phase//

====Arguments and Values====

//number// - a //[[CL:Glossary:number]]//.

//phase// - a //[[CL:Glossary:number]]//.

====Description====

**[[CL:Functions:phase]]** returns the phase of //number// (the angle part of its polar representation) in radians, in the range

''-\pi'' (exclusive) if minus zero is not supported, or ''-\pi'' (inclusive) if minus zero is supported,

to ''\pi'' (inclusive). The phase of a positive

//[[CL:Glossary:real]]//

number is zero; that of a negative

//[[CL:Glossary:real]]//

number is ''\pi''. The phase of zero is defined to be zero.

If //number// is a //[[CL:Glossary:complex float]]//, the result is a //[[CL:Glossary:float]]// of the same //[[CL:Glossary:type]]// as the components of //number//. If //number// is a //[[CL:Glossary:float]]//, the result is a //[[CL:Glossary:float]]// of the same //[[CL:Glossary:type]]//. If //number// is a //[[CL:Glossary:rational]]// or a //[[CL:Glossary:complex rational]]//, the result is a //[[CL:Glossary:single float]]//.

The branch cut for **[[CL:Functions:phase]]** lies along the negative real axis, continuous with quadrant II. The range consists of that portion of the real axis between ''-\pi'' (exclusive) and~''\pi'' (inclusive).

The mathematical definition of **[[CL:Functions:phase]]** is as follows:

''(phase ''x'') = (atan (imagpart ''x'') (realpart ''x''))''


====Examples====

<blockquote> (phase 1) → 0.0s0 (phase 0) → 0.0s0 (phase (cis 30)) → -1.4159266 (phase #c(0 1)) → 1.5707964 </blockquote>

====Side Effects====

None.

====Affected By====

None.

====Exceptional Situations====

Should signal **[[CL:Types:type-error]]** if its argument is not a //[[CL:Glossary:number]]//. Might signal **[[CL:Types:arithmetic-error]]**.
