====== System Class HASH-TABLE ======

====Class Precedence List==== **[[CL:Types:hash-table]]**, **[[CL:Types:t]]**

====Description====

//[[CL:Glossary:Hash tables]]// provide a way of mapping any //[[CL:Glossary:object]]// (a //[[CL:Glossary:key]]//) to an associated //[[CL:Glossary:object]]// (a //[[CL:Glossary:value]]//).

====See Also====

{\secref\HashTableConcepts}, {\secref\PrintingOtherObjects}

====Notes====

The intent is that this mapping be implemented by a hashing mechanism, such as that described in Section 6.4 "Hashing" of {\KnuthVolThree} (pp506-549). In spite of this intent, no //[[CL:Glossary:conforming implementation]]// is required to use any particular technique to implement the mapping.
