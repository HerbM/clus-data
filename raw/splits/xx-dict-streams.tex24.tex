====== Function READ-SEQUENCE ======

====Syntax====

**{read-sequence} {sequence stream** //\key} start end// → //position//

//sequence// - a //[[CL:Glossary:sequence]]//.

//stream// - an //[[CL:Glossary:input]]// //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]//.

//start//, //end// - //[[CL:Glossary:bounding index designators]]// of //sequence//. \Defaults{//start// and //end//}{''0'' and **[[CL:Constant Variables:nil]]**}

//position// - an //[[CL:Glossary:integer]]// greater than or equal to zero, and less than or equal to the //[[CL:Glossary:length]]// of the //sequence//.

====Description====

Destructively modifies //sequence// by replacing the //[[CL:Glossary:element|elements]]// of //sequence// //[[CL:Glossary:bounded]]// by //start// and //end// with //[[CL:Glossary:element|elements]]// read from //stream//.

//Sequence// is destructively modified by copying successive //[[CL:Glossary:element|elements]]// into it from //stream//. If the //[[CL:Glossary:end of file]]// for //stream// is reached before copying all //[[CL:Glossary:element|elements]]// of the subsequence, then the extra //[[CL:Glossary:element|elements]]// near the end of //sequence// are not updated.

//Position// is the index of the first //[[CL:Glossary:element]]// of //sequence// that was not updated, which might be less than //end// because the //[[CL:Glossary:end of file]]// was reached.

====Examples====

<blockquote> (defvar *data* (make-array 15 :initial-element nil)) (values (read-sequence *data* (make-string-input-stream "test string")) *data*) → 11, #(#\\t #\\e #\\s #\\t #\\Space #\\s #\\t #\\r #\\i #\\n #\\g NIL NIL NIL NIL) </blockquote>

====Side Effects====

Modifies //stream// and //sequence//.

====Affected By====

None.

====Exceptional Situations====

Should be prepared to signal an error of type type-error if //sequence// is not a //[[CL:Glossary:proper sequence]]//. Should signal an error of type type-error if //start// is not a non-negative //[[CL:Glossary:integer]]//. Should signal an error of type type-error if //end// is not a non-negative //[[CL:Glossary:integer]]// or **[[CL:Constant Variables:nil]]**.

Might signal an error of type **[[CL:Types:type-error]]** if an //[[CL:Glossary:element]]// read from the //stream// is not a member of the //[[CL:Glossary:element type]]// of the //sequence//.

====Notes====

**[[CL:Functions:read-sequence]]** is identical in effect to iterating over the indicated subsequence and reading one //[[CL:Glossary:element]]// at a time from //stream// and storing it into //sequence//, but may be more efficient than the equivalent loop. An efficient implementation is more likely to exist for the case where the //sequence// is a //[[CL:Glossary:vector]]// with the same //[[CL:Glossary:element type]]// as the //stream//.
