====== Variable /, //, /// ======

====Value Type====

a //[[CL:Glossary:proper list]]//.

====Initial Value====

//[[CL:Glossary:implementation-dependent]]//.

====Description====

\Thevariables{/}, \misc{//}, and \misc{///} are maintained by the //[[CL:Glossary:Lisp read-eval-print loop]]// to save the values of results that were printed at the end of the loop.

\Thevalueof{/} is a //[[CL:Glossary:list]]// of the most recent //[[CL:Glossary:values]]// that were printed, \thevalueof{//} is the previous value of \misc{/}, and \thevalueof{///} is the previous value of \misc{//}.

The //[[CL:Glossary:values]]// of \misc{/}, \misc{//}, and \misc{///} are updated immediately prior to printing the //[[CL:Glossary:return value]]// of a top-level //[[CL:Glossary:form]]// by the //[[CL:Glossary:Lisp read-eval-print loop]]//. If the //[[CL:Glossary:evaluation]]// of such a //[[CL:Glossary:form]]// is aborted prior to its normal return, the values of \misc{/}, \misc{//}, and \misc{///} are not updated.

====Examples==== <blockquote> (floor 22 7) → 3, 1 (+ (* (car /) 7) (cadr /)) → 22 </blockquote>

====Affected By====

//[[CL:Glossary:Lisp read-eval-print loop]]//.
