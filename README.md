# clus-data
This is the data for the Common Lisp UltraSpec, currently deployed at http://phoe.tymoon.eu/clus/
There are two folders there, `live` and `raw`. `live` is exactly what is currently deployed on the website and `raw` is what I am working on right now, which is not ready to be pushed to the website just yet.
