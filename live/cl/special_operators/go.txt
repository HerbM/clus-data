====== Special Operator GO ======

====Syntax====
  * **go** //tag//

====Arguments and Values====
  * //tag// - a //[[CL:Glossary:go tag]]//.

====Description====
**go** transfers control to the point in the body of an enclosing **[[CL:Special Operators:tagbody]]** form labeled by a tag **[[CL:Functions:eql]]** to //tag//.

If there is no such //tag// in the body, the bodies of lexically containing **[[CL:Special Operators:tagbody]]** //[[CL:Glossary:form|forms]]// (if any) are examined as well. If several tags are **[[CL:Functions:eql]]** to //tag//, control is transferred to whichever matching //tag// is contained in the innermost **[[CL:Special Operators:tagbody]]** form that contains the **go**. The consequences are undefined if there is no matching //tag// lexically visible to the point of the **go**.

The transfer of control initiated by **go** is performed as described in \secref\TransferOfControl.

====Examples==== 
<blockquote>
([[CL:Macros:defvar]] *val*)
([[Cl:Special Operators:tagbody]] 
   ([[CL:Macros:setf]] *val* 2)
   (go lp) 
   ([[CL:Macros:incf]] *val* 3) 
 lp 
   ([[CL:Macros:incf]] *val* 4)) <r>NIL </r>
*val* <r>6 </r>
</blockquote>

The following is in error because there is a normal exit of the **[[CL:Special Operators:tagbody]]** before the **go** is executed.

<blockquote> 
([[CL:Special Operators:let]] ((a [[CL:Constant Variables:nil]])) 
  ([[Cl:Special Operators:tagbody]]
   t 
     ([[CL:Macros:setf]] a #'([[CL:Symbols:lambda]] () (go t))))
  ([[CL:Functions:funcall]] a))
<e>Error: attempt to GO to a tag that no longer exists.</e>
</blockquote>

The following is in error because the **[[CL:Special Operators:tagbody]]** is passed over before the **go** //[[CL:Glossary:form]]// is executed.

<blockquote>
([[CL:Functions:funcall]] 
  ([[CL:Special Operators:block]] [[CL:Constant Variables:nil]] 
    ([[Cl:Special Operators:tagbody]] 
     a 
       ([[CL:Macros:return]] #'([[CL:Symbols:lambda]] () (go a))))))
<e>Error: attempt to GO to a tag that no longer exists.</e>
</blockquote>
