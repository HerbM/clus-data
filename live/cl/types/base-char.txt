====== Type BASE-CHAR ======

====Supertypes====
**base-char**, **[[CL:Types:character]]**, **[[CL:Types:t]]**

====Description====
The type **[[CL:Types:base-char]]** is defined as the //[[CL:Glossary:upgraded array element type]]// of **[[CL:Types:standard-char]]**. An //[[CL:Glossary:implementation]]// can support additional subtypes of **[[CL:Types:character]]** (besides the ones listed in this standard) that might or might not be supertypes of [[CL:Types:base-char]]. In addition, an //[[CL:Glossary:implementation]]// can define **[[CL:Types:base-char]]** to be the //[[CL:Glossary:same]]// //[[CL:Glossary:type]]// as **[[CL:Types:character]]**.

//[[CL:Glossary:base character|base characters]]// are distinguished in the following respects:

  * 1) The type **[[CL:Types:standard-char]]** is a //[[CL:Glossary:subrepertoire]]// of the type **[[CL:Types:base-char]]**. 
  * 2) The selection of //[[CL:Glossary:base character|base characters]]// that are not //[[CL:Glossary:standard character|standard characters]]// is implementation defined. 
  * 3) Only //[[CL:Glossary:object|objects]]// of the type **[[CL:Types:base-char]]** can be //[[CL:Glossary:element|elements]]// of a //[[CL:Glossary:base string]]//. 
  * 4) No upper bound is specified for the number of characters in the **[[CL:Types:base-char]]** //[[CL:Glossary:repertoire]]//; the size of that //[[CL:Glossary:repertoire]]// is //[[CL:Glossary:implementation-defined]]//. The lower bound is ''96'', the number of //[[CL:Glossary:standard character|standard characters]]//.

Whether a character is a //[[CL:Glossary:base character]]// depends on the way that an //[[CL:Glossary:implementation]]// represents //[[CL:Glossary:string|strings]]//, and not any other properties of the //[[CL:Glossary:implementation]]// or the host operating system. For example, one implementation might encode all //[[CL:Glossary:string|strings]]// as characters having 16-bit encodings, and another might have two kinds of //[[CL:Glossary:string|strings]]//: those with characters having 8-bit encodings and those with characters having 16-bit encodings. In the first //[[CL:Glossary:implementation]]//, the type **[[CL:Types:base-char]]** is equivalent to the type **[[CL:Types:character]]**: there is only one kind of //[[CL:Glossary:string]]//. In the second //[[CL:Glossary:implementation]]//, the //[[CL:Glossary:base character|base characters]]// might be those //[[CL:Glossary:character|characters]]// that could be stored in a //[[CL:Glossary:string]]// of //[[CL:Glossary:character|characters]]// having 8-bit encodings. In such an implementation, the type **[[CL:Types:base-char]]** is a //[[CL:Glossary:proper subtype]]// of the type **[[CL:Types:character]]**.

The type **[[CL:Types:standard-char]]** is a subtype of **[[CL:Types:base-char]]**.
