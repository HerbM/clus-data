====== Function CLOSE ======

====Syntax====
  * **close** //stream// ''&key'' //abort// â†’ //result//

====Arguments and Values====
  * //stream// - a //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]// (either //[[CL:Glossary:open]]// or //[[CL:Glossary:closed]]//).
  * //abort// - a //[[CL:Glossary:generalized boolean]]//. The default is //[[CL:Glossary:false]]//.
  * //result// - **[[CL:Constant Variables:t]]** if the //stream// was //[[CL:Glossary:open]]// at the time it was received as an //[[CL:Glossary:argument]]//, or //[[CL:Glossary:implementation-dependent]]// otherwise.

====Description====
**close** closes //stream//. Closing a //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]// means that it may no longer be used in input or output operations. The act of //[[CL:Glossary:close|closing]]// a //[[CL:Glossary:file stream]]// ends the association between the //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]// and its associated //[[CL:Glossary:file]]//; the transaction with the //[[CL:Glossary:file system]]// is terminated, and input/output may no longer be performed on the //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]//.

If //abort// is //[[CL:Glossary:true]]//, an attempt is made to clean up any side effects of having created //stream//. If //stream// performs output to a file that was created when the //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]// was created, the file is deleted and any previously existing file is not superseded.

It is permissible to close an already closed //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]//, but in that case the //result// is //[[CL:Glossary:implementation-dependent]]//.

After //stream// is closed, it is still possible to perform the following query operations upon it:
  * **[[CL:Functions:streamp]]**
  * **[[CL:Functions:pathname]]**
  * **[[CL:Functions:truename]]**
  * **[[CL:Functions:merge-pathnames]]**
  * **[[CL:Functions:pathname-host]]**
  * **[[CL:Functions:pathname-device]]**
  * **[[CL:Functions:pathname-directory]]**
  * **[[CL:Functions:pathname-name]]**
  * **[[CL:Functions:pathname-type]]**
  * **[[CL:Functions:pathname-version]]**
  * **[[CL:Functions:namestring]]**
  * **[[CL:Functions:file-namestring]]**
  * **[[CL:Functions:directory-namestring]]**
  * **[[CL:Functions:host-namestring]]**
  * **[[CL:Functions:enough-namestring]]**
  * **[[CL:Functions:open]]**
  * **[[CL:Functions:probe-file]]**
  * **[[CL:Functions:directory]]**

The effect of **close** on a //[[CL:Glossary:constructed stream]]// is to close the argument //stream// only. There is no effect on the //[[CL:Glossary:constituents]]// of //[[CL:Glossary:composite streams]]//.

For a //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]// created with **[[CL:Functions:make-string-output-stream]]**, the result of **[[CL:Functions:get-output-stream-string]]** is unspecified after **close**.

====Examples====
<blockquote> 
([[CL:Macros:defparameter]] *S* ([[CL:Functions:make-broadcast-stream]])) <r>*S*</r>
*s* <r>#<BROADCAST-STREAM> </r>
(close *S*) <r>[[CL:Constant Variables:T]] </r>
([[CL:Functions:output-stream-p]] *s*) <r>//[[CL:Glossary:true]]// </r>
</blockquote>

====Side Effects====
The //stream// is //[[CL:Glossary:closed]]// (if necessary). If //abort// is //[[CL:Glossary:true]]// and the //stream// is an //[[CL:Glossary:output]]// //[[CL:Glossary:file stream]]//, its associated //[[CL:Glossary:file]]// might be deleted.

====Affected By====
None.

====Exceptional Situations====
