====== Function SLEEP ======

====Syntax====
  * **sleep** //seconds// â†’ //**[[CL:Constant Variables:nil]]**//

====Arguments and Values====
  * //seconds// - a non-negative //[[CL:Glossary:real]]//.

====Description====
Causes execution to cease and become dormant for approximately the seconds of real time indicated by //seconds//, whereupon execution is resumed.

====Examples====
<blockquote>
(sleep 1) <r>NIL</r>

;;; Actually, since SLEEP is permitted to use approximate timing, this might not always
;;; yield true, but it will often enough that we felt it to be a productive example of the intent.
([[CL:Special Operators:let]] ((then ([[CL:Functions:get-universal-time]]))
      (now ([[CL:Special Operators:progn]] (sleep 10) ([[CL:Functions:get-universal-time]]))))
  ([[CL:Functions:math-not-less|>=]] ([[CL:Functions:math-subtract|-]] now then) 10)) 
<r>//[[CL:Glossary:true]]//</r>
</blockquote>

====Side Effects====
Causes processing to pause.

====Affected By====
The granularity of the scheduler.

====Exceptional Situations====
Should signal an error of type type-error if //seconds// is not a non-negative //[[CL:Glossary:real]]//.

====See Also====
None.

====Notes====
None.
