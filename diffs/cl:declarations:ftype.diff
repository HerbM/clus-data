+If one of the functions mentioned has a lexically apparent local definition (as made by flet or labels), then the declaration applies to that local definition and not to the global function definition. ftype declarations never apply to variable bindings (see type).
  The lexically apparent bindings of function-names must not be macro definitions. (This is because ftype declares the functional definition of each function name to be of a particular subtype of function, and macros do not denote functions.)
-ftype   declarations can be free declarations or bound declarations. ftype declarations of functions that appear before the body of a flet or labels     form that defines that function are bound declarations. Such declarations in other contexts are free declarations.
